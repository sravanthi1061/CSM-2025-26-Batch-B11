 Hand Gesture Controlled Smart Mattress
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a smart mattress system that allows patients, especially bedridden or disabled individuals, to adjust the bed position using hand gestures. The system uses a MEMS accelerometer sensor to detect hand movements, an Arduino to process signals, and a DC motor with driver to adjust the bed position. An LCD display provides feedback to the user.

The project eliminates the need for physical switches or remotes, making patient care more intuitive and accessible.

⚙️ Components Used

Arduino (UNO / Mega)

LCD Display (16x2)

MEMS Accelerometer Sensor (ADXL335/ADXL345)

Motor Driver (L293D / L298N)

DC Motor

Power Supply Module

12V Adapter

Connectors & Wires

🚀 How It Works

Patient makes a hand gesture (up, down, left, right).

MEMS sensor detects orientation and sends data to Arduino.

Arduino processes the signal and sends control to the motor driver.

Motor driver activates the DC motor to adjust the mattress position.

LCD shows real-time mattress status (e.g., “Head Up”, “Leg Down”).
